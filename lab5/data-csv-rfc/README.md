With the permission of Dr. Dekhtyar I have created new CSV files from the ones
provided to us. These CSV files comply to the CSV standard ([RFC 4180][1]). In
particular, they use double quotes instead of single quotes, and do not use
quotes when they are not needed. This will be useful to anyone using a CSV
implementation that does not support choosing the quote character.
